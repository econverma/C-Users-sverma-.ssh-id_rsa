# The-Happiness-Project
The goal of this project is to explore what makes people happy. 
I will be exploring dataset from the World Happiness Report 2020 based on global survey of 156 countries based on data collected through surveys from 2017-19 conducted by Gallup World Poll.The survey asked repondants to rate their life on multiple parameters on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best and 0 being the worst.The six determinants were GDP per person, healthy life expectancy, social support, perceived freedom to make life choice, generosity and perception of corruption.

In my project, I will add another variable, income ineqaulity within each country, as measured by the Gini Coefficient. Per-capita GDP captures the economic well being of the residents of a country but the GDP is not equitably distributed within the country. My hypothesis is that when people are asked about their economic well being, the disparities in income will influence their perception and hence their happiness score. 

In order to find out the effect of income inequality in a country to its happiness score, I will combine the previous happiness data set with Gini coeffients data from the Worls Bank for various countries, for the latest year that is available. I will add the Gini coefficient information from the CIA World Factbook to supplement the data for countries where World Bank data is not available.  The Gini coefficents will be scaled from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality).

Once the data set is completed, I will explore data through summary statistics as well as visualization.

Last step is to fit the best predictive model where the RMSE is the lowest.
